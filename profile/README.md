The story of Hubble began in February 2019, when our founder was planning a campaign for the Ohio State Senate. Frustrated and priced out of existing tools available for tracking finances and collecting data from social media and campaign websites, he decided to create his own solution.

As a software developer running a low-budget campaign, he knew he needed to keep costs down. So, over the next 11 months, he worked tirelessly on Hubble in his spare time, while juggling a full-time job and campaign activities in the evenings.

Although his political campaign wasn't successful, he soon found a new use for his talents as a volunteer for local congressional candidate Joel Newby. Joel's campaign needed a tool to cut turf that wouldn't break the bank, and Hubble was the perfect fit. It officially launched on February 18, 2020.

When the COVID-19 pandemic hit and forced candidates to run their campaigns online, the team behind Hubble doubled down on their efforts to create a powerful, user-friendly platform for connecting with voters remotely.

Over the years, we've continued to add features and functionality to Hubble, and we're proud to have been selected as a Mercury First Seed finalist in 2022. Today, Hubble has been used by campaigns to connect with voters throughout Ohio and beyond.
